        \n___
        \nDivide all your works into 25 minutes and be more productive!
        \n[This is known as the \"Pomodoro technique\", try looking up on Wikipedia to learn more about it]
        \n\nAll you have to do is start the timer and start doing whatever you want and do it non-stop for 25
        minutes. The app will automatically remind you to take a 5 minute break after the work period is over.
        It\'ll also notify you to start work after the break ;)
